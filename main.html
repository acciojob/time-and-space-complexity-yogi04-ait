	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>
Time complexity is a measure of the computational efficiency of an algorithm, expressing how its execution time grows with the size of the input. It helps analyze and compare algorithms based on their efficiency in handling larger datasets. Commonly denoted using Big O notation, time complexity provides an upper bound on the worst-case running time of an algorithm. Lower time complexity values generally indicate more efficient algorithms.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity,</b> denoted as O(n), signifies that the amount of memory used by an algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input, n.</p>
